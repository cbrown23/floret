## Description
Floret is a lightweight microservice framework.  Its event-driven architecture facilitates the orchestration of services to produce desired outcomes.  Each Floret service has a small scope of responsibility, and communicate directly with other Floret services via their REST APIs or with a built-in Pub/Sub system.

Typical uses:

* Abstraction of service implementations
* Tighly scoped API services
* Connector services binding services together
* Simple event handlers and emitters
